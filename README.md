# AD Clicks Prediction
The problem addressed by this project is the significant challenge faced by advertisers in accurately predicting the number of clicks on online advertisements. Achieving accurate click prediction is crucial for optimizing ad campaigns, allocating resources effectively, and maximizing return on investment. The current lack of accurate prediction models hinders advertisers' ability to make informed decisions, resulting in suboptimal campaign outcomes, wasted resources, and missed opportunities. By developing a robust machine learning model that incorporates various contextual factors, this project aims to provide advertisers with an invaluable tool to predict ad clicks with high precision, enabling them to make data-driven decisions, allocate budgets wisely, and achieve optimal campaign performance.
